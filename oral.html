<h2 id="title">Oral presentations</h2>

<p>
The goal of the oral presentations is to carry out a bibliographic study and present the result to the class. You will team in up to two in this work.
</p>

<p>
Below is a list of papers organized in categories and sub-categories, which can help in finding papers related to each other. Choose a number of papers (not less than two, perferrably not more than five) that are related to each other in a clear way. For instance, one is influenced by another, their methods are similar in some respect, they are using the same idea in different ways, or they attack the same problem from different sides. Papers should not be too hard to follow, but they should not be too easy either. They should be interesting.
</p>

<p>
The list is there only to help in initialting the study, but is by no means a constraint. You are free to start e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/recent">arXiv.org CVPR list</a>, <a href="http://openaccess.thecvf.com/menu.py">CVF CVPR/ICCV open access</a>, or anywhere else. You are also expected to find papers through citations, see below.study the related work of the papers you read and identify more.
</p>

<p>
Report your choice by <b>Tuesday, December 19</b>. Study the papers in depth. Find how they are connected. Pay attention to related work and try to identify other papers through their citations, that are more connected or more interesting. Feel free at this point to change your list of papers by removing some you found in the list and add others that you found through studying. But you should not change the subject of your study entirely.
</p>

<p>
The presentations are on <b>Monday, January 29.</b> You will have 8 minutes each for your talk plus 4 minutes for questions from the class, that is 20 minutes per team in total. You are expected to ask questions at other students' presentations. You will be evaluated based on your choice of papers, the way you have connected them into a story, and how you present them. You should focus on the main ideas. Implementation details are irrelevant for instance, but your talk shouldn't be shallow either. Your goal is to present something interesting to your fellow students, so they learn something from your talk.
